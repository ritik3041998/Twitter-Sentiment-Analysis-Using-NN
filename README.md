# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NN
Developed a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow to classify Twitter tweets as positive or negative. Preprocessed text data with NLP techniques, including tokenization and stop word removal, for improved accuracy. Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve on the Sentiment140 dataset.
1. Introduction
The project begins with an exploration of a Twitter sentiment analysis dataset. This involves understanding the data and preparing it for analysis.
2. Data Loading and Exploration
The dataset is loaded, and various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied. This might include visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the distribution of sentiment labels and the structure of the data.
3. Data Preprocessing
Text data from tweets is cleaned and preprocessed. Common preprocessing steps include:
Removing unnecessary characters (e.g., punctuation, special symbols).
Tokenization (breaking down text into individual words or tokens).
Converting text to lowercase.
Removing stopwords (common words that do not contribute to sentiment, like "and", "the").
Lemmatization or stemming (reducing words to their base form).
4. Model Training
A neural network model is built using TensorFlow or a similar deep learning framework. The model is designed to classify tweets into different sentiment categories (likely positive and negative, making it a binary classification problem).
The data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set.
5. Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help in understanding how well the model is predicting sentiments.
6. Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the steps taken in the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
The project highlights that this approach can be adapted for other text-based classification problems with some modifications.
7. Visualizations and Output
Throughout the project, various plots and visualizations are generated to illustrate the data distribution, model performance, and other key aspects.
This project provides a comprehensive workflow for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data, from initial data exploration to model training and evaluation. It also emphasizes the adaptability of the methodology for other text-based classification tasks.
